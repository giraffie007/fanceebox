h1. Fanceebox

Fanceebox is a very basic accessory though, very useful. What it does is add "fancybox":http://fancybox.net to the control panel so you can call it from your custom fields&#39; labels.

Read this "article":http://nicolasbottari.com/blog/decorate_your_custom_field_labels_in_expressionengine/ for a bit more context on adding HTML to your field labels.

You can add popups links to images, galleries and websites directly within your publish/edit page. These can be external or internal.

*New*
Now with fancybox support for your custom CP navigation via "Zoo Flexible Admin":http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/zoo-flexible-admin/.

h2. To Do Thoughts

* Would be nice to setup this up in such a way to allow the editing of the fancybox options. Currently any adjustments have to be made manually in the fanceebox.js file. This would probably have to turn into an extension.
